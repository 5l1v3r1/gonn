GoNN
========
Neural Network in GoLang

Feature
=======
* BackPropagation Network (Traditional Version)
* Parallel BackPropagation Network (each neural has its own go-routine)

TODO
=======
* currently, the parallel version is much slower than the tranditional one, maybe caused by the cost of context switch of threads
